## Adding stickers 

### Getting stickers

Find the stickers on [LINE Store](https://store.line.me/home/en) ( â€»Note: you don't need to buy them )
To add a sticker pack you'll need:

 - It's title (optional but please at least fill in something)
 - The ID of the first sticker
 - Total count of stickers in the pack

Here are the steps:
 1. Open the dialog by pressing the Menu button > Add
 2. The following dialog should show up
 3. Enter the title, amount of stickers in the pack and the ID of the first sticker, then press OK

### Getting sticker's ID and sticker count ( PC is recommended )
**Grease/Tampermonkey user script**  
If you're using **Greasemonkey** or **Tampermonkey** you can [download this user script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/23630), which will show you the first sticker ID and the sticker count

**Manual way**  
Sometimes manual way is more preferable as it doesn't require you to install anything

 1. For Firefox users, right click on the first sticker, then select **Inspect Element**; for Chrome users, right click on the first sticker, then select **Inspect**
 2. Look at the .../sticker/*[some numbers here]*/android/... part, those numbers are the **sticker ID**
 3. For the **count**, you can find out easily by counting the amount of stickers in the pack. Usually the standard for most sticker packs is 40. ( *there is exception to every rule :P* )
